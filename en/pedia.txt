# Slimes
t.pink_slime = Pink Slime
m.intro.pink_slime = Their coral hue is scientifically proven to be the color of cheer.
m.diet.pink_slime = Fruit, Veggies, Meat
m.favorite.pink_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.pink_slime = Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. Theyâ€™re cheerful, docile, \
	and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have \
	no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes.
m.risks.pink_slime = Not much to worry about with a pink slime. They're soft, squishy, very happy to be around a \
	rancher, and found all over the Range. But because of this, a rancher won't go far without finding a few pink \
	plorts, which can lead to largos, and then...
m.plortonomics.pink_slime = Pink Plorts are an excellent 'multipurpose generic substance' used to manufacture \
	everything from food products to household cleaners. All over earth, people are eating burgers, sweetening their \
	coffees or scrubbing their floors with pink plort products. That's some serious versatility!

t.rock_slime = Rock Slime
m.intro.rock_slime = These slimes ore totally metal.
m.diet.rock_slime = Veggies
m.favorite.rock_slime = Heart Beet
m.slimeology.rock_slime = Rock slimes earned their name from the rocky crown of sharp spikes atop their slimy bodies. \
	But their affection for minerals doesn't end with their appearance: rock slimes are strict vegetarians, favoring \
	the satisfying crunch of the heart beet most of all.
m.risks.rock_slime = The dangers of a rock slime should be fairly obvious: their rocky crown is sharp enough to pierce \
	straight through a rancher's boots. But it's not all about watching where you're stepping as these rocks are always \
	rolling. When you see a rock slime revving up for a tumble, it's best to get out of the way.
m.plortonomics.rock_slime = Rock plorts are prized for being a key component in the production of 'blue metal,' an \
    amazing alloy that's stronger than titanium and lighter than plastic. Because of its amazing strength, blue metal \
    is often a key component in the hulls of light-speed capable starships, synthetic appendages, and protective \
    holophone cases.

t.tabby_slime = Tabby Slime
m.intro.tabby_slime = Those stripes, that tail, that wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
m.diet.tabby_slime = Meat
m.favorite.tabby_slime = Stony Hen
m.slimeology.tabby_slime = Tabby slimes share many curious similarities to domesticated house cats of Earth. With \
    their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... if they weren't \
    made entirely of gooey slime, of course.
m.risks.tabby_slime = A tabby slime generally doesn't mean any harm to a rancher, but like their spiritual Earth cat \
    cousins, often causes a great deal of chaos anyway. Tabby slimes love to steal things they don't eat, like fruits \
    and veggies, resulting in lots of unintended largo transformations on the Range.
m.plortonomics.tabby_slime = Tabby plorts are a key ingredient in a variety of 'performance enhancing' products that \
    grant the consumer a surge of the tabby slime's signature energy and exuberance. And while athletes the world \
    over take them to gain an edge, prolonged use often results in 'uncontrollable butt wiggles,' another (less \
    desirable) signature of the tabby slime.

t.phosphor_slime = Phosphor Slime
m.intro.phosphor_slime = The softly glowing heralds of starlight.
m.diet.phosphor_slime = Fruit
m.favorite.phosphor_slime = Cuberry
m.slimeology.phosphor_slime = Phosphor slimes come out at night, flying about the moonlit range upon their translucent \
    wings. Phosphor slimes have a luminescent slime core that pulses with a soft glow, making them easy to spot. It's \
    for this reason ranchers sometimes refer to them as 'low stars.'
m.risks.phosphor_slime = Phosphor slimes have special needs compared to your typical slime. A phosphor slime and its \
    plorts will quickly vanish if exposed to sunlight, meaning a rancher could quickly lose an entire corral's worth \
    of phosphor slimes if they're not careful. Ranchers must either vac them up before daybreak or keep phosphor slimes in a \
    place that is perpetually dark, like a cave.
m.plortonomics.phosphor_slime = The luminescent compound found within phosphor plorts can produce light for over 100 \
    years, making it an incredibly eco-friendly form of illumination on Earth. Cities across the globe are slowly \
    switching over to phosphor lights, saving trillions of gigawatts of energy daily. Plus if you rub the stuff in your \
    hair, it glows and looks really cool.

t.rad_slime = Rad Slime
m.intro.rad_slime = Its radiance is so lovely it makes you sick.
m.diet.rad_slime = Veggies
m.favorite.rad_slime = Oca Oca
m.slimeology.rad_slime = It's unknown if rad slimes, sometimes called 'raddies,' came to be from external radiation \
    sources or from something naturally ocurring within the Far, Far Range. Regardless, rad slimes emit such a potent \
    aura of radiation they glow in the dark!
m.risks.rad_slime = A rad slime's radioactive aura can induce rad poisoning in a rancher if they remain within it for \
    too long. Ranchers are advised to monitor their rad exposure levels when handling these green globs of gamma goo \
    as extended exposure can cause serious bodily harm, or worse.
m.plortonomics.rad_slime = Given that raddies are basically mobile batteries, itâ€™s no surprise that corporations value \
    rad plorts for their incredible energy-producing capabilities. Most rad plorts get turned into â€˜plortoniumâ€™ and \
    everything from the latest holophone to a radwave microcook system runs on the stuff.

t.boom_slime = Boom Slime
m.intro.boom_slime = Careful, these slimes have been known to expl-
m.diet.boom_slime = Meat
m.favorite.boom_slime = Briar Hen
m.slimeology.boom_slime = Boom slimes are often heard before they're seen. The slime cells of a boom slime are \
    constantly vibrating, causing their slime to increasingly crackle with energy before ultimately exploding. \
    However, the boom slime always comes out unscathed, though always a little dazed.
m.risks.boom_slime = Boom slimes are constantly building toward an inevitable explosion, making them quite hazardous \
    to ranchers. In addition to those explosions causing bodily harm, they also have the capacity to send all nearby \
    slimes flying into the air, making them a hard slime to corral.
m.plortonomics.boom_slime = Highly volatile boom plorts have all sorts of applications, including powering rocket \
    thrusters and demolitions. Military organizations value their highly destructive capabilities for â€˜medical \
    technology and other research.â€™ Imagine that!

t.honey_slime = Honey Slime
m.intro.honey_slime = Nothing is sweeter than (a recently produced plort of) honey.
m.diet.honey_slime = Fruit
m.favorite.honey_slime = Mint Mango
m.slimeology.honey_slime = Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime \
    scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits \
    and floral nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most ranchers agree their plorts taste great on cereal.
m.risks.honey_slime = The greatest danger a honey slime poses is found in their plorts. Honey plorts are the sweetest, \
    most delicious plorts known on the Far, Far Range. Other slimes can detect them from much further away than a normal \
    plort and will do everything in their means to get them. A rancher with honey slimes needs to be careful about \
    unintended largos, or worse...
m.plortonomics.honey_slime = Honey plorts are highly prized by food manufacturers. Though the plorts are naturally \
    incredibly sweet, the discovery that they could be further refined into an even sweeter substance made their \
    demand soar. These refined honey plorts are said to score an unprecedented 867 on the Werner-Thompkins-Hong \
    sacchrino scale, just a few points shy of 'not fit for human consumption.'

t.hunter_slime = Hunter Slime
m.intro.hunter_slime = Nevermind the rabbit, have you seen any chickens?
m.diet.hunter_slime = Meat
m.favorite.hunter_slime = Roostro
m.slimeology.hunter_slime = The hunter slime is the wild cousin of the tabby slime. A much more capable creature than \
    the playful tabbies, the hunter slime excels at stalking the chickens of the Far, Far Range.\n\
    \n\
    A hunter slime's slimological makeup allows for a natural cloaking ability that renders it almost completely \
    invisible. Their only tell is in their giant, almond eyes, which can often be seen hovering in the dark. This \
    effect is often described by unsuspecting ranchers as 'aaaahhhhHHH!'
m.risks.hunter_slime = A hunter slime has keen senses and can detect its prey from great distances. This makes \
    finding a good location for their corrals challenging.\n\
    \n\
    Additionally, the wild nature of the hunter is also passed on to any largos formed from its plorts. A newly \
    created hunter largo will always be feral! A prepared rancher knows that breeding hunter largos should always be \
    done slowly, with a few chickens on hand to calm them down.
m.plortonomics.hunter_slime = Amazingly, a serum can be made from hunter slime plorts that can actually render a person \
    invisible! The effect only lasts for about a day, but this serum is nonetheless incredibly popular back on Earth \
    as many people find its effects very soothing.\n\
    \n\
    Sometimes you feel like you just want to disappear for a while. But then about a day goes by and you realize that \
    not only did you miss being seen, but others missed seeing you too.

t.puddle_slime = Puddle Slime
m.intro.puddle_slime = Keep one in your boot and you'll always stay cool. But it's weird.
m.diet.puddle_slime = Water
m.favorite.puddle_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.puddle_slime = Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the \
    range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water \
    into their bodies while they sit on the surface of a pool.\n\
    \n\
    Puddle slimes need fresh water to survive and will quickly evaporate if left on any other surface for too long.
m.risks.puddle_slime = Puddle slimes aren't risky to manage, they just require a fair bit of maintenance. A rancher \
    needs a pool of fresh water, like a pond, available for a puddle slime to sit in as they will evaporate if away \
    from water. Additionally, puddle plorts burst as soon as they touch anything but fresh water.\n\
    \n\
    Finally, puddle slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they are in close proximity to more \
    than 3 other slimes.\n\
    \n\
    Overall, a puddle slime is a better fit for a more experienced rancher, not one still wet behind the ears.
m.plortonomics.puddle_slime = Puddle plorts are made almost entirely from an incredible hydro compound known by \
    chemists across the galaxy as H2Ohhhhh. This compound is used to create an absurdly expensive brand of bottled \
    drinking water that is sought after by the elite back on Earth. While some people argue that there is little \
    difference in taste between it and tap water, those people seriously are not getting it.

t.crystal_slime = Crystal Slime
m.intro.crystal_slime = It's as clear as shiny, transparent rocks that these slimes are dangerous.
m.diet.crystal_slime = Veggies
m.favorite.crystal_slime = Odd Onion
m.slimeology.crystal_slime = Believed to be a cousin of the rock slime, the crystal slime is covered in a crown of \
	shimmering, crystal spikes. These spikes seem to form from the crystal slime generating a tremendous amount of \
	internal heat and warping the minerals around them; a truly alien behavior.
m.risks.crystal_slime = The sharp crystals adorned on the crystal slime's crown will cause a great deal of harm if \
	touched. Worse still, the crystal slime routinely creates large patches of hazardous crystals in the \
	environment around them. Thought to be a means of expelling internal heat, these crystal patches are ultra-hot, \
	and can be shattered if splashed with water.
m.plortonomics.crystal_slime = Though the crystals produced by a crystal slime are highly unstable, a crystal plort, \
	like all plorts, is far more pure and can be used by slime scientists to engineer a variety of metals that are \
	completely transparent. This innovation has led to metropolitan areas on Earth completely transforming visually, \
	allowing more light to reach the streets and the space as a whole a chance to 'breathe.' Architects often describe \
	these transparent metals as 'so totally cooler than normal, boring metals.'

t.quantum_slime = Quantum Slime
m.intro.quantum_slime = A slime that really shows its potential.
m.diet.quantum_slime = Fruit
m.favorite.quantum_slime = Phase Lemon
m.slimeology.quantum_slime = Quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort of event that took place in the \
    Ancient Ruins long ago. At all times, the quantum slime is capable of emitting other possible realities of their \
	being. Called 'ghosts,' these other realities can come true, with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of \
	the ghost, effectively teleporting.
m.risks.quantum_slime = Quantum slimes can be one of the most difficult slimes to manage, given their unique \
    abilities. A rancher needs to learn to detect when quantum slimes are primed to take over the reality of a ghost \
	and act quickly, such as feeding them or just splashing them with some fresh water as a temporary measure.
m.plortonomics.quantum_slime = Quantum plorts are believed by many to hold the secret to infinite resources.  Given \
    the quantum slime's ability to change reality, it's theorized that unlocking the potential of quantum plorts could \
	allow for a technology that converges the realities of other entities into our reality and- well, basically we're \
	talking about cloning stuff. Infinite energy, chickens, whatever. Probably no harmful side effects to this at all.

t.tarr_slime = The Tarr
m.intro.tarr_slime = Those awful, ravenous, rainbows.
m.diet.tarr_slime = Slimes
m.favorite.tarr_slime = Ranchers!
m.slimeology.tarr_slime = The tarr are formed when a largo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. A terrible \
    transformation occurs that turns the slime into a sludge filled with a swirling, prismatic array of colors and a \
    relentless appetite. The tarr seek only to consume and replicate.\n\
    \n\
    The only way to stop a tarr outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the slime sea is with fresh water. One \
    splash will stop a tarr from spawning new tarr, and repeated splashes will destroy it entirely.\n\
    \n\
    Alternatively many ranchers recommend running away with their arms waving, and screaming.
m.risks.tarr_slime = The tarr are the single biggest threat to ranchers. The tarr will seek out slimes to consume \
    and replicate themselves, but will also devour chickens, rot crops in their proximity, and even devour ranchers! \n\
    \n\
    Remember: ranching largos may be highly profitable, but one stray plort and you could wind up with a devastating \
    tarr outbreak.
m.plortonomics.tarr_slime = The tarr produce no plorts, only more tarr. And then more tarr still.

t.gold_slime = Gold Slime
m.intro.gold_slime = Get rich or die sliming.
m.diet.gold_slime = Exclusive
m.favorite.gold_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.gold_slime = The most elusive and sought after of all slime species is easily the gold slime. Very little \
    is known about these slippery creatures as they have proven impossible to capture. Gold slimes are quick as a flash \
    and will immediately begin to flee ranchers on sight. If a rancher is to profit from an encounter with a gold slime, \
    they need to think quick.
m.risks.gold_slime = Gold slimes produce no direct risks to a rancher but their appearance often induces panic and \
    leads to (sometimes fatal) mistakes. Further, the only way to obtain gold plorts is to strike a gold slime with \
    any spare resources in your vac. Doing so can produce a gold plort, though it also leaves a trail of additional \
    resources in the area, leading to unintended largos, or worse.
m.plortonomics.gold_slime = Gold plorts have little practical use and are the most valuable of all plorts simply \
    because they are shiny and rare. Back on Earth, the elite love to adorn themselves in jewelry made of gold plorts, \
    far exceeding the value of any terrestrial precious metal. For this reason a rancher should never pass up the \
    chance to get a gold plort or two from a chance encounter with a gold slime.

t.lucky_slime = Lucky Slime
m.intro.lucky_slime = Oooh, shiny!
m.diet.lucky_slime = Meat
m.favorite.lucky_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.lucky_slime = Lucky slimes are a strange variant of tabby slimes that seem to have a fascination with \
    shiny objects, particularly newbuck coins. A lucky slime gobbles up any coin it can find, giving it a distinct \
    jingling sound as they move about.\n\
    \n\
    However, coins don't make for a balanced diet and a lucky slime will still greedily devour meat of any kind. In \
    so doing, its body bursts with a shower of newbucks, having little room left in its slimy tummy. This burst often \
    sends the lucky slime flying into the air.\n\
    \n\
    Upon detecting a rancher, the lucky slime will soon make a hasty retreat. No known rancher has ever been skillful \
    enough, or perhaps lucky enough, to capture one of these slippery slimes.
m.risks.lucky_slime = Lucky slimes pose the same risk to ranchers as other rare slimes: mainly, accidents in their \
    pursuit that can lead to a rancher's demise. The promise of a small fortune when encountering a lucky slime has \
    led more than a few ranchers head-first into the slime sea.\n\
    \n\
    This occurence has led some of the more superstitious ranchers to see the lucky slime as a bad omen, or perhaps as \
    the universe testing their greed. These ranchers will ignore lucky slimes altogether, even purposefully shooing \
    them away. Well, until you hear those newbucks jingling, and then, maybe just one shot couldn't hurt...
m.plortonomics.lucky_slime = A lucky slime isn't known to produce plorts of any kind. Leading slime scientists believe \
    this to be the result of the lucky slime not being a true slime variant. Rather, lucky slimes are believed to be just \
    an abnormal tabby slime: one whose color has faded as a result of ingesting so many coins. It is perhaps this very \
    change that also led to ceasing plort production.

t.largo_slime = Largo Slimes
m.intro.largo_slime = There's just more to love.
m.diet.largo_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.largo_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.largo_slime = Largo slimes are a hybrid of two slimes resulting from a slime eating a plort unlike its own. \
	They are twice as big as normal slimes and have a combined diet of their two source slimes, making them enticing for \
	ranchers that want to maximize their profits. \n\
	\n\
	However, a largo is too big to vac and can only be transported using the end of the vac nozzle. This makes \
	them difficult to control if things get out of hand.
m.risks.largo_slime = In addition to largos being more difficult to manage and having the combined powers of two \
	slimes, an even greater threat to ranchers lies within these super-sized slimes. If a largo eats a plort \
	unlike its two source slimes, it will transform into a ravenous tarr slime! \n\
	\n\
	Ranchers need to be very careful when dealing with largos or risk an outbreak of tarr that can quickly overtake \
	their entire ranch. Always carry a full tank of water just in case!
m.plortonomics.largo_slime = When a largo eats, it produces plorts of both source slime types, making them potentially \
	very lucrative for ranchers that can deal with the added risk of keeping them.

t.gordo_slime = Gordo Slimes
m.intro.gordo_slime = Bon appetit!
m.diet.gordo_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.gordo_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.gordo_slime = Gordo slimes are a rare phenomenon that occurs when multiple slimes of the same type \
	congregate. The result is that the slimes seem to merge together into a much larger slime that is seemingly \
	incapable of movement. \n\
	\n\
	A gordo will eat until it bursts, causing all the slimes to separate once more, as well as revealing whatever \
	object it was that caused the gordo to form in the first place.
m.risks.gordo_slime = Gordos pose no real risk to ranchers, they can only sometimes be a nuisance in that they \
	are hiding something a rancher might need. So if you see a gordo, feed it!
m.plortonomics.gordo_slime = Gordos produce no plorts on their own, however the slimes they produce after \
	bursting do like any normal slime.

t.feral_slime = Feral Slimes
m.intro.feral_slime = It's hard to be nice on an empty stomach.
m.diet.feral_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.feral_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.feral_slime = Feral slimes are largos with a mean streak that will attack a rancher on sight. \
	It's not known what exactly causes a largo to become so grumpy that it goes feral, but it's suspected \
	that they've simply gone too long without a bite to eat. Like so many things with slimes, food is everything. \n\
	\n\
	If a feral slime eats, it will revert to a normal largo.
m.risks.feral_slime = Feral slimes can pose a serious risk to ranchers if they're not dealt with quickly, or \
	avoided altogether. Feral slimes will attempt to bite ranchers at close range or jump in the air and try \
	to stomp them with their... butts? In any case, a rancher needs to act fast and feed the feral slime something \
	tasty to avoid such troubles.
m.plortonomics.feral_slime = Feeding a feral slime not only calms it down, but it also produces plorts in the same \
	manner as a largo. Though, there are certainly easier ways out there to acquire plorts!

# Resources
t.carrot = Carrot
m.intro.carrot = Next to a vacpack, it's a rancher's best friend.
m.favored_by.carrot = (none)
m.resource_type.carrot = Veggie
m.how_to_use.carrot = Deposit a carrot into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large carrot crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.carrot = The humble carrot was brought to the Far, Far Range because they're easy to grow and nutritious. \
	Most ranchers swear by them as they're a handy portable snack, promote good night vision, and when juiced \
	are second only to coffee as the perfect morning beverage.

t.ocaoca = Oca Oca
m.intro.ocaoca = A tubular mix of colorful spuds.
m.favored_by.ocaoca = Rad Slime
m.resource_type.ocaoca = Veggie
m.how_to_use.ocaoca = Deposit an oca oca into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large oca oca crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.ocaoca = A staple of cooking on the range, the hearty oca oca is a naturally salty, soft spud. As the key \
    ingredient to the always tasty 'rancher's hashbrowns' they have likely been the fuel for a great deal of slime \
    wrangling since their discovery on the range.

t.beet = Heart Beet
m.intro.beet = If you listen to it closely, you can faintly hear a veggie.
m.favored_by.beet = Rock Slime
m.resource_type.beet = Veggie
m.how_to_use.beet = Deposit a heart beet into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large heart beet crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.beet = Heart beets get their name from their deep, red color and heart-like shape. Heart beets are also \
    unusually juicy for a beet, making it the only veggie that's not for the squeamish in the kitchen.

t.onion = Odd Onion
m.intro.onion = I wouldn't trust this onion, even less so than a normal onion.
m.favored_by.onion = Crystal Slime
m.resource_type.onion = Veggie
m.how_to_use.onion = Deposit an odd onion into a garden's depositor and strangely, carrots will begin to grow. However, \
	there is a good chance you'll get some odd onions in the crop as well. This crop will last for several harvests. 
m.desc.onion = Odd onions can only be foraged in the wild from the Indigo Quarry; however, you'll never encounter an odd \
	onion patch. Instead, odd onions can be found randomly in other veggie patches. As the saying goes, 'forage in the Indigo \
	Quarry and you'll always find the odd onion in your haul.'

t.parsnip = Silver Parsnip
m.intro.parsnip = Like a carrot's rich, sophisticated cousin. Also, it's silver.
m.favored_by.parsnip = Meteor Slime
m.resource_type.parsnip = Veggie
m.how_to_use.parsnip = Deposit a silver parsnip into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large silver parsnip crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.parsnip = Despite their slightly metallic aftertaste, these shimmering root veggies are considered a delicacy \
    by gourmands across the galaxy. On the Far, Far Range, ranchers often eat them during the holidays, to bring good \
    fortune in the coming year.

t.pogo = Pogofruit
m.intro.pogo = The most common fruit found on the Range, and some say, the most delicious.
m.favored_by.pogo = (none)
m.resource_type.pogo = Fruit
m.how_to_use.pogo = Deposit a pogofruit into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large pogofruit tree of your very \
    own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.pogo = Pogofruit are a common sight almost anywhere on the Far, Far Range. Tasting a bit like a peach, they're \
    most notable for having their trademark spots both on and under the skin.

t.mango = Mint Mango
m.intro.mango = Intensely sweet with a cool, minty finish.
m.favored_by.mango = Honey Slime
m.resource_type.mango = Fruit
m.how_to_use.mango = Deposit a mint mango into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large mint mango tree of your \
    very own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.mango = The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is that of a mango, with a \
    thicker, syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty aftertaste. It's no wonder honey slimes seek them out or that they \
    have such amazingly fresh breath.

t.cuberry = Cuberry
m.intro.cuberry = Delicate, sweet, and they never roll off the table.
m.favored_by.cuberry = Phosphor Slime
m.resource_type.cuberry = Fruit
m.how_to_use.cuberry = Deposit a cuberry into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large cuberry tree of your very \
    own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.cuberry = Due to their sweet taste and curious shape, cuberries were quick to become a favorite amongst the \
    first ranchers on the range. They are often used in cakes and pies when celebrating special occasions, like \
    birthdays or Plortapalooza.

t.pear = Prickle Pear
m.intro.pear = This is a fruit that knows how to fight back.
m.favored_by.pear = Mosaic Slime
m.resource_type.pear = Fruit
m.how_to_use.pear = Deposit a prickle pear into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large prickle pear tree of your \
    very own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.pear = (Description Forthcoming)

t.lemon = Phase Lemon
m.intro.lemon = Plucked from a tree rooted in the... past? Future? Or...?
m.favored_by.lemon = Quantum Slime
m.resource_type.lemon = Fruit
m.how_to_use.lemon = Deposit a phase lemon into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large phase lemon tree of your \
    very own. This tree will last for several harvests. 
m.desc.lemon = A phase lemon comes from a different place and time. They are like an echo, reverberating \
    through the halls of the Ancient Ruins, never staying in the same place for long.\n\
	\n\
	In order to harvest phase lemons a rancher must pass fruit matter through the phase lemon tree when lemons are \
	present. This process somehow removes the fruit from our reality and phases in a lemon in exchange.


t.chickadoo = Chickadoo
m.intro.chickadoo = So little and soft you'd think they're filled with marshmallow.
m.favored_by.chickadoo = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.chickadoo = Future Meat
m.how_to_use.chickadoo = Keep chickadoos in a safe place and they'll eventually grow into a hen hen or roostro.
m.desc.chickadoo = Chickadoos are baby chickens that will eventually grow into a hen hen or more rarely, a roostro.\n\
    \n\
    Chickadoos of all varieties will never be eaten by slimes. Some believe this is because slimes are too kind-hearted \
    to do such a thing. Others believe it's because chickadoos don't yet have enough meat on their bones.

t.stony_chickadoo = Stony Chickadoo
m.intro.stony_chickadoo = This little chick had quite a hard upbringing.
m.favored_by.stony_chickadoo = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.stony_chickadoo = Future Meat
m.how_to_use.stony_chickadoo = Keep stony chickadoos in a safe place and they'll eventually grow into a stony hen or roostro.
m.desc.stony_chickadoo = Stony chickadoos are baby chickens that will eventually grow into a stony hen or more rarely, a roostro.\n\
    \n\
    Chickadoos of all varieties will never be eaten by slimes. Some believe this is because slimes are too kind-hearted \
    to do such a thing. Others believe it's because chickadoos don't yet have enough meat on their bones.

t.briar_chickadoo = Briar Chickadoo
m.intro.briar_chickadoo = A breed of chick that's totally bush-league.
m.favored_by.briar_chickadoo = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.briar_chickadoo = Future Meat
m.how_to_use.briar_chickadoo = Keep briar chickadoos in a safe place and they'll eventually grow into a briar hen or roostro.
m.desc.briar_chickadoo = Briar chickadoos are baby chickens that will eventually grow into a briar hen or more rarely, a roostro.\n\
    \n\
    Chickadoos of all varieties will never be eaten by slimes. Some believe this is because slimes are too kind-hearted \
    to do such a thing. Others believe it's because chickadoos don't yet have enough meat on their bones.

t.henhen = Hen Hen
m.intro.henhen = A hearty chicken bred to be twice as tasty as its cousin on Earth.
m.favored_by.henhen = (none)
m.resource_type.henhen = Meat
m.how_to_use.henhen = Hen hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.henhen = Hen hens are a special breed of chicken bred to survive the climate of the Far, Far Range. \
    While appearing more or less like a big chicken, these burly birds are much more adept at fending for themselves, \
    making them ideal for ranchers who might otherwise be distracted by a few hundred hungry slimes.

t.stony_hen = Stony Hen
m.intro.stony_hen = Has a rock solid conviction... in chicken stuff.
m.favored_by.stony_hen = Tabby Slime
m.resource_type.stony_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.stony_hen = Stony hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce stony chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.stony_hen = Stony hens are thought to have evolved from hen hens who once trekked deep into the mountains of the Far, Far \
    Range. Perhaps these birds were seeking a clarity of mind that one can only truly obtain through meditation amongst those \
    lofty, barren crags. But most likely, they were just stupid and got lost.

t.briar_hen = Briar Hen
m.intro.briar_hen = A real wild bird that loves to ramble in the bramble.
m.favored_by.briar_hen = Boom Slime
m.resource_type.briar_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.briar_hen = Briar hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce briar chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.briar_hen = Briar hens are a chicken variant born from the wild thickets of the Far, Far Range. They were first discovered \
    long ago by an explorer who noted that they seemed to have a complex tribal structure, and a fascinating series of chicken \
    customs. He even may have joined the briar tribe as an honorary chicken himself! His records end there however, and we know \
    nothing else about him or his findings. Oh, but his name was Carl. We know that.

t.roostro = Roostro
m.intro.roostro = Struts his stuff like he's king of the coop.
m.favored_by.roostro = Hunter Slime
m.resource_type.roostro = Meat
m.how_to_use.roostro = All hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come to a \
    halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their coops from \
    exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.roostro = Roostros are the alpha birds on the Far, Far Range and half of the equation required to breed \
    chickens on the ranch. However, roostros are rarer than any hen making them a great find any time one is discovered.\n\
    \n\
    To acquire a roostro, either find one out on the range or breed them on the ranch. Any type of chickadoo has a small \
    chance of growing into a roostro. Some ranchers believe that these odds increase if you greet the Rooster King's \
    crow at sunrise with an enthusiastic 'good morning!'

t.elder_roostro = Elder Roostro
m.intro.elder_roostro = Shakes his tail feathers and no one cares.
m.favored_by.elder_roostro = (none)
m.resource_type.elder_roostro = Meat
m.how_to_use.elder_roostro = An elder roostro can no longer sire chickadoos and serves no other purpose than becoming a \
    slightly tough chicken dinner.
m.desc.elder_roostro = Elder roostros are the senior-aged roostros who have retired from the otherwise bustling life of their \
    younger counterparts. 'Young roostros crow too much, they move too fast, and frankly have no respect for their elders,' \
    an elder roostro might say of youths; as they make a gross, smacking sound with their lips. Though this is of course \
    impossible, as roostros do not have lips.

t.elder_hen = Elder Hen
m.intro.elder_hen = An old bird whose egg-laying days are over, easy.
m.favored_by.elder_hen = (none)
m.resource_type.elder_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.elder_hen = An elder hen can no longer lay eggs and serves no other purpose than becoming a slightly \
    tough chicken dinner.
m.desc.elder_hen = Elder hens have lived a full-feathered life. They've met the roostro of their dreams, seen their \
    little chickadoos grow up, and are ready to start the next chapter of their chicken lives. In all likelihood this will \
    include getting the names of countless books, movies and actors wrong. But don't blame them for that. They're chickens \
    for goodness sake.

t.primordy_oil_craft = Primordy Oil
m.intro.primordy_oil_craft = This stuff is pre-pre-prehistoric.
m.favored_by.primordy_oil_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.primordy_oil_craft = Slime Science Material

    \n\
    Found deep below the surface of the Far, Far Range, primordy oil is an ancient substance containing a wide array \
    of organic compounds, making it perfect as a base for many Slime Science creations.

t.deep_brine_craft = Deep Brine
m.intro.deep_brine_craft = Salt of the earth kind of stuff.
m.favored_by.deep_brine_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.deep_brine_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.deep_brine_craft = Deposit deep brine into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.deep_brine_craft = Deep brine is a common resource exclusive to the Dry Reef, obtained with a pump.\n\
    \n\
    Not safe for drinking, deep brine is thought to be water from the Slime Sea that has been filtered by \
    the subterranean coral of the Dry Reef. It is significantly denser than fresh water and loaded with salt.

t.spiral_steam_craft = Spiral Steam
m.intro.spiral_steam_craft = If you search for it, you'll find something wonderful.
m.favored_by.spiral_steam_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.spiral_steam_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.spiral_steam_craft = Deposit spiral steam into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.spiral_steam_craft = Spiral steam is an uncommon resource obtained with a pump.\n\
    \n\
    Found in highly pressurized vacuums of rock below the surface, spiral steam exhibits a curious behavior \
    when released into the atmosphere, swirling into a series of dancing spirals before dissipating. It is valued \
    for the countless micro-particles found within the steam itself. 

t.lava_dust_craft = Lava Dust
m.intro.lava_dust_craft = A survey on the state of this matter answered 'undecided.'
m.favored_by.lava_dust_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.lava_dust_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.lava_dust_craft = Deposit lava dust into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.lava_dust_craft = Lava dust is a rare resource obtained with a pump.\n\
    \n\
    Neither a solid or a liquid, lava dust seems to be something in between, having the characteristics of both. \
    It is believed to be a mixture of magma and slime, though this has never been proven. And despite its name, lava dust \
    is only warm to the touch.

t.buzz_wax_craft = Buzz Wax
m.intro.buzz_wax_craft = Can be used to make a great scented candle if you enjoy the smell of bee abdominal glands.
m.favored_by.buzz_wax_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.buzz_wax_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.buzz_wax_craft = Deposit buzz wax into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.buzz_wax_craft = Buzz wax is a common resource obtained with an apiary.\n\
    \n\
    Just like bees on Earth, bees on the Far, Far Range produce a waxy substance that they use to form their hives. \
    Buzz wax is the still malleable deposits of unused wax found in apiaries. It has many practical uses ranging \
    from building materials to medicines. You can also chew it as the worst gum in the world.

t.wild_honey_craft = Wild Honey
m.intro.wild_honey_craft = Tastes great in tea or in shameful handfuls when no one is looking.
m.favored_by.wild_honey_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.wild_honey_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.wild_honey_craft = Deposit wild honey into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.wild_honey_craft = Wild honey is a common resource exclusive to the Moss Blanket, obtained with an apiary.\n\
    \n\
    All the rich pollens and sweet nectars found in the forests of the Moss Blanket combine in a beautiful alchemy \
    to form some of the most delicious honey in the galaxy. Wild honey is a staple of rancher life; a dollop of it \
    makes just about any food taste better, and it provides a natural boost of energy to get through a tough day of \
    wrangling slimes. 

t.hexacomb_craft = Hexacomb
m.intro.hexacomb_craft = Bee stuff and geometry: the chocolate and peanut butter of nature.
m.favored_by.hexacomb_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.hexacomb_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.hexacomb_craft = Deposit hexacomb into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.hexacomb_craft = Hexacomb is an uncommon resource obtained with an apiary.\n\
    \n\
    Hexacomb is the result of bees arranging buzz wax into complex patterns to store their honey and eggs. \
    Why the hexagonal shape? Bees understand that the hexagon is the shape of the future. Bees were Sci-Fi before it was cool.

t.royal_jelly_craft = Royal Jelly
m.intro.royal_jelly_craft = The king of all jellies... that is, until you meet the queen.
m.favored_by.royal_jelly_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.royal_jelly_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.royal_jelly_craft = Deposit royal jelly into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.royal_jelly_craft = Royal jelly is a rare resource obtained with an apiary. \n\
    \n\
    The royal jelly found in the hives across the Far, Far Range is special as it is unnaturally sweet compared to \
    other varieties. It's believed that this is a result of bees collecting small deposits of slime from honey slimes \
    and working it into their royal jelly mixture. If a rancher is lucky enough to acquire some, they'll find its \
    unique properties are very valuable in certain Slime Science endeavors. 


t.jellystone_craft = Jellystone
m.intro.jellystone_craft = It's both solid and squishy at the same time.
m.favored_by.jellystone_craft = (not slime food)

    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.jellystone_craft = Jellystone is a common resource obtained with a drill.\n\
    \n\
    Jellystone is a semi-hardened mixture of minerals and slime, possibly resulting from plorts sinking back into \
    the earth below. Because of its softer texture, it's a favorite stone for sculptors.

t.indigonium_craft = Indigonium
m.intro.indigonium_craft = Heavy metal experts often call this hard rock 'deep purple.'
m.favored_by.indigonium_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.indigonium_craft = Slime Science Material
m.how_to_use.indigonium_craft = Deposit indigonium into the Lab's Refinery where it can then be used for fabricating \
    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.indigonium_craft = Indigonium is a common resource exclusive to the Indigo Quarry, obtained with a drill.\n\
    \n\
    Indigonium is the ore that gives the Indigo Quarry its name. There's a little indigonium found in every inch \
    of the quarry, but the purest ore is only found deep underground.

t.slime_fossil_craft = Slime Fossil
m.intro.slime_fossil_craft = If history could smile, it would look like this.
m.favored_by.slime_fossil_craft = (not slime food)

    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.slime_fossil_craft = Slime fossils are an uncommon resource obtained with a drill.\n\
    \n\
    Prized for the ancient minerals they contain, slime fossils are like nature capturing a moment in time. \
    Specifically, that moment seems to be when a great avalanche or mudslide occurred and a slime was totally cool with it.

t.strange_diamond_craft = Strange Diamond
m.intro.strange_diamond_craft = Very strange, but even more valuable.
m.favored_by.strange_diamond_craft = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.strange_diamond_craft = Slime Science Material

    Slime Science gadgets.
m.desc.strange_diamond_craft = Strange diamonds are a rare resource obtained with a drill.\n\
    \n\
    Even in the dark, these diamonds seem to shine as if light is passing through them. Strange diamonds are \
    highly valued for their use in a variety of warp tech processes. Being almost impossibly dense and intricate \
    in their composition, a strange diamond can reflect light within itself so profoundly that it actually bends time.

t.echoes = Echoes
m.intro.echoes = A mote of light, or perhaps, a memory?
m.favored_by.echoes = (not slime food)
m.resource_type.echoes = Unique
m.how_to_use.echoes = Echoes can be used as decorations. Simply vac them up and shoot them anywhere you want. They'll \
	hover in that spot until you vac them up.
m.desc.echoes = Within the crumbling walls of the Ancient Ruins, small traces of energy can be found, never staying \
    in one place for very long. Called echoes, they are believed to be a phenomenon resulting from some kind of \
	ancient event. Since they are harmless, echoes are often collected by ranchers as good luck charms or used as \
	decorations.\n\
	\n\
	Echoes appear regularly in the nooks and crannies of the Ancient Ruins, as well as from extractors.

t.slime_toys = Slime Toys
m.intro.slime_toys = Never quit playing around.
m.favored_by.slime_toys = (Varies by slime)
m.resource_type.slime_toys = Unique
m.desc.slime_toys = Slime toys come in a variety of forms, and all reduce slime agitation of any nearby slimes, so it's \
    a good idea to toss one in a corral for slimes to enjoy.\n\
    \n\
    Each slime has a favorite toy, which reduces their agitation even more. A largo will favor either of its types.\n\
    \n\
    The soothing quality of slime toys do not stack, so while you don't need more than one in a corral, it certainly \
    doesn't hurt anything either!

# Ranch Tech
t.corral = Corral
m.intro.corral = A happy slime makes for a happy rancher.
m.desc.corral = A corral is used to keep slimes on a ranch. The open-air corrals are designed for maximum \
	slime satisfaction, with the rich soil of the Range beneath them and its expansive sky above them. \
	Slimes will remain perfectly happy within corrals so long as they are fed regularly.\n\
    \n\
    Remember: You can shoot things THROUGH a corral barrier. Handy!
m.upgrade.name.corral.walls = High Walls
m.upgrade.desc.corral.walls = Higher corral walls ensure that even the bounciest of slimes will have difficulty escaping.
m.upgrade.name.corral.music_box = Music Box
m.upgrade.desc.corral.music_box = The music box plays a soothing tune that greatly reduces slime agitation.
m.upgrade.name.corral.air_net = Air Net

m.upgrade.name.corral.plort_collector = Plort Collector
m.upgrade.desc.corral.plort_collector = A plort collector will vacuum up two types of plorts in a corral at regular \
    intervals, depositing them into a storage tank, so long as space is available.
m.upgrade.name.corral.feeder = Auto-Feeder
m.upgrade.desc.corral.feeder = An auto-feeder will drop food into the corral at regular intervals. Just \
    remember to keep it stocked!

t.coop = Coop
m.intro.coop = Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.
m.desc.coop = Though many ranchers simply let their chickens roam the ranch, a coop is the tool of the serious \
	poultry producer. Coops keep hens and roostros close, allowing for maximum egg-laying potential. Just \
	remember to avoid crowding the coop: chickens won't reproduce when in close proximity to more than a dozen \
	other hens or roostros. But give them room and watch the love bloom.
m.upgrade.name.coop.walls = High Walls
m.upgrade.desc.coop.walls = Great for keeping chickens in and hungry slimes out.
m.upgrade.name.coop.feeder = Spring Grass
m.upgrade.desc.coop.feeder = Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that chickens just love to eat. With their bellies \
    full, hens will produce eggs twice as fast.
m.upgrade.name.coop.vitamizer = Vitamizer
m.upgrade.desc.coop.vitamizer = The very latest in advanced poultry tech, the vitamizer bathes the chickens in \
    'vita-rays,' allowing them to grow into healthy hens and roostros twice as fast.

t.garden = Garden
m.intro.garden = Nothing beats the taste of food grown in your own backyard.
m.desc.garden = The gardens used by ranchers use advanced technology to rapidly grow clones of fruits and \
	veggies in a natural, though greatly sped up, way. By placing a sample into the replicator, the garden's \
	soil is instantly populated by a fruit tree or veggie patch that will go on to produce several harvests of produce.
m.upgrade.name.garden.sprinkler = Sprinkler
m.upgrade.desc.garden.sprinkler = A sprinkler ensures that your crops are always watered, making them grow twice as fast.
m.upgrade.name.garden.soil = Nutrient Soil
m.upgrade.desc.garden.soil = Nutrient soil contains compost from the Moss Blanket and minerals from the Indigo \
	Quarry. Makes crops always yield the maximum harvest.
m.upgrade.name.garden.scareslime = Scareslime
m.upgrade.desc.garden.scareslime = A scareslime is a stuffed tarr model designed to keep wandering slimes away from \
    your crops. Simple, but terrifying.

t.silo = Silo
m.intro.silo = You can't take it with you when you go, so put it in storage.
m.desc.silo = A silo lets a rancher neatly store plorts and resources in a handy, compact unit. Simply shoot into \
	an available silo port to fill it, or vac it to retrieve the items within. Remember, a clean ranch is a happy ranch!
m.upgrade.name.silo.storage2 = Additional Storage
m.upgrade.desc.silo.storage2 = A silo can have up to four ports for storing plorts and resources.

t.incinerator = Incinerator
m.intro.incinerator = Don't need it? Burn it!
m.desc.incinerator = An incinerator will instantly burn anything it touches into ash, and then burn that ash into \
	nothing. It's an excellent solution for eliminating a tarr outbreak or for simply disposing of unwanted \
	slimes if you're a terrible, heartless monster.

t.pond = Pond
m.intro.pond = Water you going to do with this?
m.desc.pond = A pond gives you a source of fresh water on the ranch that you can use for watering gardens, calming \
    slimes in a corral, defeating tarr, or giving your puddle slimes a place to hang out.\n\n\
    A pond will be slowly consumed if vac'd up or drunk up by puddle slimes, but will also slowly refill over time. \
    You can transfer unused water from your vacpack to a pond, and they will refill immediately when it rains.

t.plort_market = Plort Market
m.intro.plort_market = Feed slimes. Collect plorts. Get paid.
m.desc.plort_market = The plort market is a network of buyers and sellers of plorts across the galaxy. Ranchers use \
    plort market machines on their ranch to send plorts to the market for sale. Ranchers are paid immediately when \
    depositing plorts at the plort's current market value.\n\n\
    Plort market values fluctuate and some of the more savvy ranchers will hoard certain plorts for days when sale \
    prices are high, especially rare plorts.

t.overgrowth = The Overgrowth
m.intro.overgrowth = The ranch's very own wild side.
m.desc.overgrowth = The Overgrowth is an expansion to the ranch that is covered in moss and tall grasses. The \
    thicket it creates allows for fruits and veggies to grow naturally and attracts the occasional wild chicken, \
    making it an ideal space for a rancher that wants to let their slimes roam more freely.

t.grotto = The Grotto
m.intro.grotto = A dark and gloomy cavern above the sea and a likely first chapter to that novel of yours.
m.desc.grotto = The Grotto is an expansion to the ranch set inside a (slightly spooky) cave that allows a rancher to \
    care for light-sensitive slimes without the need for a solar shield. Never has a phosphor slime felt so liberated.

t.lab = The Lab
m.intro.lab = Allows you to begin your career as an amateur, unlicensed Slime Scientist.
m.desc.lab = The Lab is an expansion to the ranch that houses a barn containing Hobson's old, Slime Science workshop. \
    Once unlocked, the Lab will allow you to fabricate dozens of useful gadgets using Slime Science!\n\
    \n\
    It is recommended that only more experienced ranchers unlock the Lab, as Slime Science requires a great many \
    resources and lots of newbucks to fully master.

t.docks = The Docks
m.intro.docks = Deep, deep down in the great, blue sea, I saw a thousand slimes smiling back at me.
m.desc.docks = The Docks is an expansion to the ranch that repurposes a cozy, little lookout along the waterfront. \
    This expansion offers a few extra ranch patches flanked on several sides with fishing nets. The nets can be used \
    to temporarily catch escaped slimes or as a means of creating physical collages of slimes because it's fun.\n\
    \n\
    It also houses a natural wellspring, allowing you to fill your tank with unlimited fresh water, or for a few puddle \
    slimes that prefer a natural place to soak.

t.partner = 7Zee Rewards Club
m.intro.partner = Style. Sophistication. Other good things. 7Zee.
m.desc.partner = The 7Zee Rewards Club is an optional program that allows you to purchase prestigious rewards for \
    large sums of newbucks. Each rank brings unique rewards and a new rank title.\n\
    \n\
    Some ranchers point out that the whole thing seems like a way of siphoning enormous sums of newbucks in exchange \
    for fancy colors and trophies that don't actually serve any real purpose. But those ranchers aren't sporting \
    the latest, most fashionable vacpack colors and obviously cannot be trusted.

t.chroma = Chroma Packs
m.intro.chroma = A picture is always more beautiful when there are more colors than you can count.
m.desc.chroma = Chroma Packs can be applied from the terminal on the ranch earned in the 7Zee Rewards Club. They \
    allow you to apply color schemes you have earned to your ranch house, vacpack, and ranch tech such as corrals and silos.\n\
    \n\
    You can acquire more chroma packs by continuing to rank up in the 7Zee Rewards Club. Only the most successful ranchers \
    will be able to show off the rarest chroma packs!

# Range
t.reef = The Dry Reef
m.intro.reef = A coral-crusted ocean floor that now basks under a golden sun.
m.desc.reef = The environment surrounding the ranch is known as the Dry Reef and is an arid, wind-swept land covered \
    in dusty crags and rocky cliffs shaped by the wind over the millennia.\n\
    \n\
    The Dry Reef is primarily home to pink, tabby, and rock slimes though phosphor slimes will also come out of \
    hiding when the sun sets. The Dry Reef's climate doesn't make for an abundance of any particular resource, but plenty \
    of carrots, pogofruit, and hen hens are everywhere, as well as some less common resources if you know where to look.

t.quarry = The Indigo Quarry
m.intro.quarry = All that remains of a mining project that quickly went bust.
m.desc.quarry = The Indigo Quarry is a winding network of caves and cliffs, striated with deep purple hues from the rare \
    minerals found within it. It was once the site of a mining project but went bust after the discovery that the rare ores \
    it produces quickly break down in atmospheres other than that of the Far, Far Range.\n\
    \n\
    It was later discovered that the means to harness these metals was via rock slime plorts. Somehow, rock slime plorts \
    preserve the minerals within, a process that eludes even the most prestigious slime scientists.\n\
    \n\
    The Indigo Quarry is a natural home for rock slimes and the more elusive rad slime, and its naturally mineral-rich soil \
    make it a great place to harvest most wild veggies.

t.moss = The Moss Blanket
m.intro.moss = Like a flower blooming from a rocky crack, this emerald expanse hints at what could be.
m.desc.moss = The Moss Blanket is an island covered in a thick layer of moss where flora grows wild in great, tangling \
    knots at every turn. The high walls of the cliffs surrounding the island and its great canopy of trees allow for sea \
    mists to pass in and become trapped, creating a unique climate within the otherwise arid range.\n\
    \n\
    The slimes primarily found within the Moss Blanket find its jungle-like conditions perfect: tabby and boom slimes \
    hunt their prey through the thickets with abandon, and honey slimes lounge in the flower beds, eating the great \
    abundance of fruit that can be found at every turn.

t.ruins = The Ancient Ruins
m.intro.ruins = All that is lost is eventually found, and lost once more.
m.desc.ruins = Hidden behind a vast mountain range, the Ancient Ruins stand as one of the few known unnatural \
    structures on the Far, Far Range. Their origin remains a mystery, as do the strange occurences that happen \
	within.\n\
	\n\
	Home to quantum slimes that seem to express many other possible realities of their being, and phase lemon trees \
	that do not remain in one time or place for very long, the Ancient Ruins defy logic and expectation.\n\
	\n\
	Only one thing is certain in the Ancient Ruins: within its deepest chambers lies its greatest secret.

t.desert = The Glass Desert
m.intro.desert = TBD
m.desc.desert = TBD

t.sea = The Slime Sea
m.intro.sea = An expansive body of water and slime compound that's not fit for swimming, let alone drinking.
m.desc.sea = The Slime Sea that covers most of the Far, Far Range is something of a mystery. It is seemingly a mixture \
    of water and slime that is believed to be the primordial pool whence all slimes emerged, though its true purpose is \
    entirely unknown by even the most esteemed slime scientists.\n\
    \n\
    What is known is that the liquid found within the Slime Sea is not fit for drinking, watering crops, or even \
    swimming, as most things seem to quickly sink to the bottom. When a slime enters the slime sea it quickly vanishes \
    but it is widely believed that this far from ends the slime's existence, for slimes that enter the sea can often \
    be seen quickly reappearing back on land, happy as ever. In fact, many slime scientists believe that slimes use the \
    sea as a means of transportation, moving swiftly below the surface and popping out on land wherever they see fit.\n\
    \n\
    But all theories aside, one fact remains very clear, most especially to ranchers: don't enter the Slime Sea!

t.the_ranch = The Ranch
m.intro.the_ranch = A distant home for distant hearts.
m.desc.the_ranch = Beatrix begins her life on a humble ranch in the middle of an area of the Far, Far Range known as the \
    Dry Reef. Once the property of the legendary slime rancher and notorious old codger, Hobson Twillgers, the ranch \
    has seen better days, as Hobson let it come into a state of disrepair shortly before disappearing completely.\n\
    \n\
    Hobson's whereabouts are currently unknown.

t.keys = Slime Keys
m.intro.keys = An ancient key for an ancient lock.
m.desc.keys = Slime Keys are large, stone keys that are used to open the ancient slime gates across the range. \
    These gates often lead to new areas to explore or create shortcuts to familiar ones.

t.refinery = Refinery
m.intro.refinery = The first step to building fantastic gadgets.
m.desc.refinery = Using advanced technology, the Refinery breaks down plorts and other resources to their molecular \
  level, allowing them to be fabricated into various Slime Science gadgets. Aside from plorts, the bulk of resources \
  you will use in Slime Science will be obtained from extractors.\n\
  \n\
  Be sure to choose what to deposit into the Refinery wisely: any resources you deposit cannot be removed from the \
  refinery, but instead used only for building gadgets.

t.fabricator = Fabricator
m.intro.fabricator = Let's get crafty.
m.desc.fabricator = The Fabricator allows you to craft gadgets from a blueprint using resources you have stored in the \
  Refinery. You can generally build as many gadgets of a specific blueprint as you wish, however some special gadgets \
  have build limits, allowing you to only own a certain number of them at a time.

t.blueprints = Blueprints
m.intro.blueprints = All great scientists have a plan... most of the time.
m.desc.blueprints = Blueprints allow you to craft gadgets at the Fabricator. Once you own a blueprint for a specific \
  gadget, you can craft it as many times as you like, provided you have the necessary resources and are not exceeding \
  the build limit.\n\
  \n\
  Blueprints can be purchased from the Builder's Shop, or found in treasure pods throughout the Far, Far Range. Some \
  of them are hiding in really secret spots!

t.extractors = Extractors
m.intro.extractors = Nature is a treasure hoarder.
m.desc.extractors = Extractors are a special class of Slime Science gadgets that are essential for building all other \
  types of gadgets. Extractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries.\n\
  \n\
  Once placed on a build site, an extractor will begin working, collecting resources from the environment over time. \
  Once it is full of resources, an extractor can be emptied. The best extractors can repeat this cycle multiple times \
  before they finally break down.\n\
  \n\
  Each extractor can find exclusive resources if used in the correct zone:\n\
  Pumps can find a special resource in the Dry Reef.\n\
  Drills can find a special resource in the Indigo Quarry.\n\
  Apiaries can find a special resource in the Moss Blanket.

t.utilities = Utilities
m.intro.utilities = Tools for getting the job done.
m.desc.utilities = Utilities are a class of Slime Science gadgets that provide useful features to aid you in managing \
  your ranch, as well as exploring the range.\n\
  \n\

m.intro.warp_tech = Try not to think about how it works.
m.desc.warp_tech = Warp tech is a class of Slime Science gadgets that allow you to harness the power of instantaneous \
  travel. It includes teleporters that you can use to create shortcuts, as well as gadgets that allow you to transport \
  items.\n\
  \n\

t.decorations = Decorations
m.intro.decorations = Be the best rancher, but do it in style.
m.desc.decorations = Decorations are a class of Slime Science gadgets that allow you to decorate the world with \
  attractive objects or recreations of natural findings from the environment.\n\
  \n\
  Craft decorations in order to make your slime ranching a more beautiful experience!

t.curios = Curios
m.intro.curios = Because why not?
m.desc.curios = Curios are a class of Slime Science gadgets that while functional, are not necessarily useful. Curios \
  include toys, games, and other gimmicky gadgets that can be a great time with an equally great imagination.\n\
  \n\
  Craft curios in order to make your slime ranching a little sillier (which is the best kind of slime ranching, to be \
  honest).
