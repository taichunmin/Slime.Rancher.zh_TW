### Exchange Intro mails
m.subj.exchangeintro_thora = Welcome to the Range Exchange!
m.from.exchangeintro_thora = Thora West
m.body.exchangeintro_thora = Hi there, Beatrix! The name's Thora West. I'll keep my introduction short on account that we all got work to do: I'm a long-time rancher here on the Far, Far Range and head of the welcome wagon for your local Range Exchange.\n\n\
  The Range Exchange is a network of ranchers just like yourself who are looking to trade what they got for what they need: slimes, plorts, food- whatever. All you need to do is check out the Range Exchange machine daily and be sure to get your trade completed by noon.\n\n\
  As more ranchers get added to your network, you should receive a hearty hello from them so check your inbox.\n\n\
  Well, enough jawin,' we've both got slimes to wrangle.\n\n\
  Adios, Beatrix.\n\n\
  - Thora

m.subj.exchangeintro_viktor = Salutations, Ms. LeBeau
m.from.exchangeintro_viktor = Viktor Humphries
m.body.exchangeintro_viktor = Allow me to introduce myself. I am Viktor Humphries; professional slime rancher, slime scientist, and amateur musician. My understanding is that Ms West has already informed you of how the Range Exchange works so I will spare you any further education.\n\n\
  Instead, I'll illuminate you on what you can expect from my own requests. As a slime scientist/rancher I have a tremendous interest in the liquiform legion that we share this vast range with, the slimes. My studies often keep me from venturing out on the range daily and when I find myself short of a particular species, I use the Range Exchange to fill that gap. Don't worry though, I will reimburse you handsomely for your efforts.\n\n\
  Good luck in your new venture, Ms LeBeau. I look forward to seeing life breathed once again into the former Twillgers Ranch.\n\n\
  Sincerely,\n\
  Viktor Humphries\n\n\
  P.S. - I once lost my most favorite fiddle while fleeing a feral boom slime. Its value is only sentimental but should you find it, I'd very much love to be able to play it again.

m.subj.exchangeintro_ogden = Hiya Beatrix!
m.from.exchangeintro_ogden = Ogden Ortiz
m.body.exchangeintro_ogden = The name's Ogden Ortiz. I'm a slime rancher much like yourself but I mostly fancy myself as a farmer. I came to the Far, Far Range to grow fruits and veggies the way we used to back on earth: by getting down into the soil and getting your hands dirty.\n\n\
  Did you know that carrots improve your night vision? Yeah, seriously, they do! I don't see why all ranchers aren't just gobbling them down every chance they get. Being lost out on the range at night can be so dangerous...\n\n\
  Well don't let me ramble on ya here. We'll be in touch via the Range Exchange. I tend to only raise slimes that eat fruits and veggies, so expect those kinds of requests from me.\n\n\
  Lookin forward to doing business with ya!\n\n\
  O.O.\n\n\
  P.S. - Ever hear of gilded ginger? It's a mythical veggie that is said to be the favorite food of the equally mythical gold slime. But some say that neither of them actually exist!

m.subj.exchangeintro_mochi = (no subject)
m.from.exchangeintro_mochi = Mochi Miles
m.body.exchangeintro_mochi = Well, well it seems like another wannabe rancher has signed up for a lonely existence on a faraway space rock. Congrats Beatrix!\n\n\
  I'm Mochi Miles. That's 'Miles' as in Tatsuya Miles, the billionaire. I'm here to do important business for my dad but that doesn't mean I won't make all the rest of these backwater types out here look bad in the process. No one conquers the plort market like I do: day in, day out.\n\n\
  My dad gives me the inside track so look forward to my requesting plorts that I know will make me huge profits later on.\n\n\
  So I wish you the best of luck, Beatrix. Maybe you'll even reach second place! And at the very least you can tell your friends that you helped out the great Mochi Miles in her conquest of the Far, Far Range!\n\n\
  Later, tater.\n\n\
  Mochi Miles, Top Rancher

### Personal mails
m.subj.casey_1 = Rise and shine!
m.from.casey_1 = Casey
m.body.casey_1 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    What's it like to sleep for a whole year? Did you dream? I can't imagine what that's like. 7Zee puts you in a pod and then lights out for all that time... wow.\n\n\
	What's the Far, Far Range like? Have you started exploring? Is the air as clear as they say? I bet it's really beautiful.\n\n\
	I'm probably asking too many questions. I bet you have a lot of work to do. The pics of that ranch were pretty run down. I still can't believe it's yours now.\n\n\
	I guess I better leave you to it. Be thankful that I didn't send any of the mails I wrote you over the last year. You would have had a whole novel to read when you woke up!\n\n\
	I'll keep it short: good luck, Bea. If anyone can make it out there, it's you.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_2 = My pet cactus
m.from.casey_2 = Casey
m.body.casey_2 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
	I bought a cactus from you, sort of. When I came back home it was one of the only things left in your shop. Was a lonely little guy so I decided to adopt it.\n\n\
	You know I kill every plant I touch, but I promise you this one will last. I mean, if I can't keep a cactus alive then clearly something is really wrong!\n\n\
	When I look at it I think of you out there on the range, doing your thing. Hope you're ok.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_3 = Re: The big storm
m.from.casey_3 = Casey
m.body.casey_3 = Of course I remember that day. I feel like that was when you and I really connected. It was raining so hard that the streets were flooding and we took shelter in that cafe. It was like a scene from a movie only we both looked like wet animals. And the guy running the shop was a real tyrant. The only way we could stay inside was by ordering one coffee after another.\n\n\
	I felt like we learned more about each other that day than ever. Maybe it was the coffee because we were both talking really, really fast. I told you about my dreams; making music and all that. At least that's how I remember it.\n\n\
	Walking home, my heart was racing when the rain came back and you got closer to me. But I couldn't blame that on the coffee.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_4 = Halloween
m.from.casey_4 = Casey
m.body.casey_4 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
	We never really talked about the Halloween party. Now that you're away, I keep thinking of all these times where I didn't have the words. I guess now I finally do. Maybe it's because I know I won't run into you on the street or something. It just makes it all easier.\n\n\
	Right, so, the Halloween party. I didn't know that you would be there. And I didn't know that you didn't know I had met someone. I should have told you. But you know how it was; we never really moved things forward. I think I got scared that someone got so close to me. It was just easier to create some space, easier to just focus on music.\n\n\
	I wish I could have talked to you then, but you had already left. I guess I have a habit of just missing you. Really missing you.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_5 = Re: A year and a half abroad
m.from.casey_5 = Casey
m.body.casey_5 = I remember seeing you just before you left. I think things were cool with us then, right? You seemed really confident, driven to go out there and see the world.\n\n\
	I was jealous of you then. You were just going for it and I still didn't have the guts to chase my dream. I was still working in that terrible bar, putting up with terrible people in hopes of a little stage time.\n\n\
	That was a hard time. Once we started calling each other none of it made any sense any more. What were we then?\n\n\
	I guess that's always been our problem, right? It's like we could never really answer that question.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_6 = Moving back home
m.from.casey_6 = Casey
m.body.casey_6 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
	I never told you this, but the reason I moved to San Francisco was to be closer to you. I think at the time I convinced myself that it was for the music but it was for you.\n\n\
	I was lonely in LA and I just wanted to be around someone who understood me. I think that sometimes that's all anyone really needs. Someone who knows you love to dance but you're terrible at it, or that you sound like a monster when you snore. I think it's those things that keep people close. The rest is just pretending.\n\n\
	There's something else I never told you: you sound like whatever a monster is afraid of when you snore. I think if I listened closely tonight, I might actually hear you from Earth.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_7 = New Year's Eve
m.from.casey_7 = Casey
m.body.casey_7 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
	Today was a bad day for me. Nothing went my way and I feel like garbage. So I'm downing a bottle of wine here and looking out at the city and thinking about that New Year's Eve when we got lost looking for a party. Do you still think about that night?\n\n\
	Nothing went right that night until it all suddenly did. While we were wandering around the city, lost, I got my bearings and didn't tell you because I knew we were close to that coffee shop run by the tyrant. And since it was starting to rain I thought it would be really romantic to stumble across the place again. I guess I finally found the courage.\n\n\
	But the coffee shop went out of business and it was a taco place now. So, we ate tacos in the rain and it was just the best thing.\n\n\
	I kissed you that night on the roof of your old apartment. I wanted fireworks then but it was raining and cold. It didn't matter. Everything wrong was right that night.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_8 = Re: London
m.from.casey_8 = Casey
m.body.casey_8 = I know, I just left. But I never meant for it to be a breakup. Things were so good with us and a chance to tour and play every night in real venues was everything I ever wanted. I just thought that somehow we'd get through the distance thing. I knew you couldn't go with me.\n\n\
	Looking back I was crazy to think it could work. We were finally close and true and then all of a sudden there were a few thousand miles between us. But this was my dream. I could not and still cannot resolve that. What do you do when being with someone means giving up on something that defines you?\n\n\
	It doesn't matter. I should have told you then what I never did. I should have said it a hundred times.\n\n\
	- Casey

###### Hobson Journals
m.journal.jo_ranch_lab = I built this lab after meeting a slime scientist and learning about the wonders of plort technology. I figured it would be fun to tinker with on rainy days.\n\n\
I only nearly blew myself up three times, which is pretty good given my tendency for that sort of thing in my other hobbies. But it soon became a reminder that I have a thirst for adventure, and being cooped up in a barn all day wasn't ever going to satisfy that thirst.\n\n\
Soon, I began to set my sights for horizons beyond this ranch. And once I got to thinking on it, further still.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_grotto = Before I left the ranch I found myself sleeping most nights in this here grotto. I'd fill it full of phosphor slimes and watch them dance in the dark. Drifting off, I'd pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars, across the limitless black of space.\n\n\
It's funny how when you dream, you sure become a sucker for the impossible. Every time I woke to find myself back in the grotto I'd feel a little sadness. But then it was back to work. There was always something that needed doing.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_overgrowth = I built this area myself by spreading soil from the Moss Blanket all over the ground, just to see what would happen. I was hoping it would attract a hunter slime or two, but no such luck. Maybe I need to get some of them big mushrooms to grow here instead? They sure seem to like hanging out around those things.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_docks = A view of the sea really reminds you of our greater purpose, Beatrix. The sea was the first great unknown, and then space, and then whatever is beyond all that. That need to see what's around the next corner is in my bones, and since you're out here, I reckon it's in yours too.\n\n\
Though, I suppose you could also be out here because you like the fresh air. Or you prefer the untamed beauty of this land. Or maybe it's because you're looking to leave something far behind ya. Sure is the way to do it; doesn't get much further than this.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_intro = Hello Beatrix!\n\n\
The name's Hobson Twillgers: rancher, explorer, and the former owner of this here ranch you now call your own. Pleased to make your acquaintance!\n\n\
I was a rancher for more years than I can remember and felt there was one last adventure left in me so I've set off to find just that. But before I go I'm taking one last tour around this here land I love. So keep your peepers peeled for notes like these, if you want to hear what an old coot has to say every now and again.\n\n\
Be talking to ya!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_circles = I used to come to this beach to think. I'd sit and stare at that those distant rings and ruminate on who created them and for what purpose.\n\n\
But most of all, I'd sit here and think of her.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_bigtree = I had a great, big tree like this here one along the edge of my property back on Earth. It had been there before anyone could remember. It survived all kinds of change around it and then one day I began to notice it was dying.\n\n\
Wasn't anything unnatural, was just its time I suppose. And then I realized that if I didn't do something, I'd end up like that tree: I'd spend my whole life in the same place.\n\n\
I wasn't going to let that happen. So I bought a ticket for the Far, Far Range the very next day.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_boot = I once lost a boot off this here cliff.\n\n\
Now, I never said that these journals would be full of important information. And to be fair, it was a darn good boot.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_curious = If you're reading this, you must be a naturally curious person who doesn't mind a little risk now and again.\n\n\
I think if we ever met, we'd get along just fine.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_ferals = This entire cave system was sealed off from a cave-in when I first discovered it. Maybe that's why the fellas up ahead are so grumpy: haven't had a bite in a long time.\n\n\
In any case, don't let that long-awaited bite come from your own rump! Bring some food to calm them down.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_exit = The first time I went exploring the Moss Blanket I got stuck here so I constructed a way out. It's just up yonder.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_forest = The Moss Blanket may seem like an ancient jungle of sorts, but the fact is that much of what you see here wasn't even around when I first began exploring this land. At this rate, I reckon that it won't be long before this greenery completely overtakes the Far, Far Range!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_love = Have you ever been in love, Beatrix? Makes you feel all achy inside, like a day after your soul's been to the gym. That's the best way I can describe it, anyway.\n\n\
It also realigns your thinking to something you swear is downright alien. All those things you thought really mattered suddenly don't. Changes you entirely!\n\n\
Can't recommend it enough.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_danger = I highly advise you have a jetpack and a few upgrades before tackling what's ahead. The land is all broken and twisted and there's plenty of feral slimes about who you won't see coming before they blast you right into the sea.\n\n\
Keep those peepers peeled!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_springs = I used to come here when I needed a good soak. It's a great way to clear your head.\n\n\
Sometimes I'd catch a puddle slime blushing and I could never tell if it was because I was in my bathing suit or not.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_crystals = I once came here to collect crystals for a little project of mine. Was trapped here for nearly two days when those curious crystal slimes came rolling my way and started firing off those dangerous shards. I thought I was gonna kick the bucket!\n\n\
The crystals were for a wind chime. I bet Thora still has it hanging from her porch.\n\n\
Worth it.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_stars = It was here that I knew I had to leave once again. I had spent the entire day exploring, trying to find my way to this island. And though I spent the rest of the night walking along the shore in the soft glow of these fireflowers, I caught myself looking up again and again.\n\n\
Once more, I was looking to the stars.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_alone = I was always happiest when I was by my lonesome. Places like this old quarry really suited me: nice and quiet and mostly empty. So I figured that life on the Far, Far Range would suit me just as well.\n\n\
And well wouldn't you just know it? I come all this way and the first person I see... well, she changed how I saw things I guess. Quiet wasn't good anymore. I liked her laugh.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_lemons = The ghostly phase lemon trees that you may have seen were a real head scratcher to me for the longest time. I kept dreaming about an ice-cold glass of lemonade on the long summer days I spent exploring these ruins. Delicious stuff!\n\n\
But here's the trick: if you want those lemons, you've got to be willing to part with a fruit of your own. Give it a shot.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_intro = Fascinating aren't they? Who do you think constructed these ancient ruins, and for what purpose? I'd visit this place and ponder that question often. Only one thing is for certain: these folks liked slimes!\n\n\
Eventually I came to realize what this place was for and how to utilize it.\n\n\
Will you do the same?\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_doors = These strange, glass doors are a good reminder that you can't always have both. Hit that switch over there all you like and both doors will never be open.\n\n\
Sometimes you gotta choose one path or another and there's no way around it. But you know what? Either path you choose is gonna make you hurt some for want of walking the other.\n\n\
Life is filled with doors like these.\n\n\
- H
